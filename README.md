# Best_Ball_Draft_Helper
This is a repository of python code intended to use data analysis and machine learning techniques to help me draft in my Best Ball League.

We primarily use the Python data analysis library Pandas to perform data analysis on fantasy football data.

Planned additions: 
2024 Draft board
Touchdown regression candidate calculator for all positions

2023_Draft_Board.py  -  This holds the first version of my draft board creater using data from the 2023 season. We use Pandas to web scrape projected stats and average draft position (ADP) data from FantasyPros.com to compute projected fantasy points and value over replacement (VOR) points. This is compiled into a .csv file that can be used as a draft board for a Best Ball draft.
